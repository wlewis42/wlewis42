- 👋 Hi, I’m @wlewis42
- 👀 I’m interested in efficiently storing data in a way that makes access second nature and using data to make predictions in intelligent ways.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning pivot tables, seaborn, GraphQL, Tailwindcss, RedwoodJS, among many others.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on opportunities to learn and develop new data skills.
